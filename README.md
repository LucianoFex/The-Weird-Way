## Requeriments

### In case of using the .py files:

- Programming Language "[Python](https://www.python.org/)" (version 3 or higher).
- Python "Pygame" library. (You have to install it with the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/).
- Python "Tkinter (Tcl/Tk)" library. (It's a part of the "standard libraries" of Python, so you already have it).

### In case of using the .exe file:

- [Winrar](https://www.winrar.es/) software. (You can use another data compression software. For example [7-Zip](https://www.7-zip.org/)).


## How to Run

### In case of using the .py file:
- Run the "TheWeirdWay.py" file in the terminal.
- In case you don't want to use the program with the terminal behind,
      you can change the file type "TheWeirdWay.py" to "TheWeirdWay.pyw".

### In case of using the .exe file:
- You'll have to extract the "TheWeirdWay.rar".
- Then if you want to execute the .exe file, you will have to go to the next Path:
  'TheWeirdWay/dist/TheWeirdWay' and execute the file "theweirdway.exe" to start the game.
